I'm a junior working towards a degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Mobile Computing planning on graduating in Spring of 2020.

I'm from Cameron, Missouri with my hobbies including music, distance running, soccer, and being an active member of Sigma Tau Gamma.

As for after gradation I'm currently unsure as to what I want to go invest time into, preferably somewhere to work with Swift but I'm not opposed to doing work with android.

The only real interesting thing that comes to mind about me is that I love Horology and currently have 12 watches in my collection. Below is a link to my LinkedIn account.
